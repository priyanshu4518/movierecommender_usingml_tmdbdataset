# Movie Recommender System

## Description
This project is a movie recommender system built using machine learning techniques and the TMDB dataset. The system recommends movies based on various features such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew 
## Usage
To use the movie recommender system, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook Untitled1.ipynb
    ```

2. **Follow the instructions in the notebook** to preprocess the data, train the model, and make recommendations
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, which includes information about movies such as genres, keywords, cast, and crew.

- **tmdb_5000_credits.csv**: Contains information about the cast and crew of movies.
- **tmdb_5000_movies.csv**: Contains information about the movies
- ## Features
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends movies based on the similarity of movie features.
